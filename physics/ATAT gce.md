## procedure
- Read in the `lattice file`
- Determine the space group of this lattice, output in `sym.out` file
- Find all  symmetrically distinct clusters, with parameter `-n` restricting the maximum distance.
- Write all clusters found to `clusters.out`
- Read in the `structure file` and calculate the clusters of the structure by the pattern chosen earlier.


## questions
- What is `lattice file` and `structure file`?
- What is the content of `gcetensor.in`?

## progresses
- stop
