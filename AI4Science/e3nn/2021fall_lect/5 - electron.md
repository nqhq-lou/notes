title: Electron densities with e3nn
tags: [e3nn/lect]
---

## motivation
- for large systems, we use MD methods for simulation
- but MD has radius cutoff, while some important interatomic interactions are related to atoms far apart.
- considering that the force actually comes from the electrons, we should get the electron density and then calculate the force.
