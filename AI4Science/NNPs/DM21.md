## gradient training

- add $\delta E_{SCF}^2$ to learning objectives as regularization
	- to avoid making spuriously large orbital rotations away from reasonable orbitals during SCF iteration
	- $\delta E_{SCF}$ could be easily obtained after single SCF iteration.
	- $\delta E_{SCF}^2$ is from HF mean-field method.
	- This is cheaper than monitoring explicitly.



## keys
- $\delta E_{SCF}^2$ is introduced
	- 

- FC and FS balanced & accurate calculation.
	- **Why FC and FS meaningful?**
	- Said that FC and FS are composed physics circumstances.
- grid method
	- Treutler, Mura-Knowles, Delley, and Gauss-Chebyshev schemes
	- built-in in PySCF.
	- why use all the grid schemes?
- 密度信息和spin联系?
- 加法的方法, 来保证精确度?
- UEG Constraint



诶诶还是没看懂是怎么SCF起来的
