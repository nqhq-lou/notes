Include a large variety of chemicals, methods and orbitals.


## chemical choosing criteria
- The error bars on the Enthalpy of formation are less than or equal to 8 kJ/mol.
- The species contains no atoms with atomic number greater than 35 (bromine). Except there are a few molecules containing Iodine. We are slowly adding a few molecules containing the first-row transition metals.
- The species contains six or fewer heavy atoms and twenty or fewer total atoms. This allows species as large as hexane.
- The above constraints have been loosened to include some larger species (substituted benzenes, cyclooctatetraene, S8, naphthalene, adamantane)
